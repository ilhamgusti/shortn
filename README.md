# Shortn - URL Shortener

Shortn is a personal project to learn and practice Rust programming, utilizing the powerful `actix-web` framework to build a URL shortener service. This README will document the project's features, development, and progress.

## Features

Shortn is planned to include the following features:

### Core Features (To-Do)
- [ ] **URL Shortener**  
      Convert long URLs into short and shareable ones.

- [ ] **QR Code Generation**  
      Generate QR codes for the shortened URLs.

- [ ] **Rate Limiter (Per IP)**  
      Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse by setting a maximum request rate per IP.

- [ ] **Click Statistics**  
      Track the total number of clicks on each shortened URL.

- [ ] **Password-Protected Short URLs**  
      Allow users to lock their short URLs with a password.

- [ ] **Expiration-Based Short URLs**  
      Add an expiration date to short URLs, after which they will no longer work.

### Additional Features to Explore (To-Do)
- [ ] **Custom URL Aliases**  
      Allow users to specify custom aliases for their short URLs (e.g., `shortn.io/custom-alias`).

- [ ] **API Support**  
      Expose an API for developers to programmatically shorten URLs and retrieve analytics.

- [ ] **User Authentication**  
      Enable users to create accounts and manage their URLs.


- [ ] **Dark/Light Theme for QR Codes**  
      Customize the QR code colors to fit user branding or preferences.

- [ ] **Bulk URL Shortening**  
      Allow users to shorten multiple URLs at once via file upload or API.

- [ ] **Custom Expiry Times**  
      Provide more flexible options for setting expiration times (e.g., hours, days, weeks).

---
- [ ] **Malware/Phishing Detection**  
      Scan and warn users if the original URL points to potentially harmful content.

- [ ] **Preview Page for Links**  
      Show a preview page (with metadata like title, description, and image) before redirecting to the original URL.

- [ ] **Analytics Dashboard**  
      Provide a user-friendly dashboard to view detailed statistics (e.g., geolocation, browser, platform) for each URL.


## Development Goals
This project aims to improve understanding of:
- The Rust programming language
- Web application development using `actix-web`
- Backend architecture design
- Implementing security and scalability in web services
